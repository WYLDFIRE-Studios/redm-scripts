Welcome to Syn Trains 

Notes: 
-only run the containers sql if you dont own syn society. 
- use /dv to delete trains 
- when on the train the upgrade menu uses the right arrow instead of enter. 
- trains speed is maxed at 30 mph 
- read the notes written in the config
- make sure you are on the discord and have the role of the script to get help/updates
- give your train engineers the recipies for fixing trains ooc. those are not mentioned anywhere in game in the script. (this acts as an education in rp) 
- always press E after upgrading or fixing the trains. the process places you under the train
